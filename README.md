# Addon description
Have you ever wanted to be a vampire? Now you can! The vampire craft addon is inspired by a famous java mod with the same theme. In it it is possible to transform into a vampire, drink blood, unlock various abilities, among other things. Only ours allows all this with the possibility of becoming a werewolf.
